# Machine_Learning
This project focuses on building a classification model using the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning. The goal is to predict the species of an iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on four measurable features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.
